					I notice that my hair is growing thicker in the crown of my head and that I have more dark hair growing as opposed to greys. I'm taking some other supplements as well, but not until I added this product to my diet did I start to notice the changes. I am 61 years old and generally look much younger around 50-55, but I was not having much success with regrowth of hair in and around the crown of my head. When I talked to my hair dresser, she would just say not to be too concerned 'cause I have lots of thick hair everywhere else, but I WAS concerned and my sister who does a tremendous amount of research to find the best product for the very least price recommended these vitamins. Also my split fingernail is gone and I even had a compliment on my manicured fingernails, when the truth is. I haven't had a manicure in over 5 years!

					I'm in my early 30's...have great skin and hair and nails....just wanted to try something more to really amp up my beauty routine....because beauty does begin within....and so i bought Natures Bounty Hair Skin And Nails....due to all the added great beauty ingredients like high percentage of biotin per serving and added antioxidants like A,C and E PLUS MY FAV. HYALURONIC ACID, Argon Oil is even here...i don't know too many supplements that have that added in their vitamins at this awesome price.I honestly love these vitamins....i have noticed a huge difference in the radiance and feel of my skin.It has like an internal bounce almost like firm jelly in it.My face has a nice thickness to it too and these seem to work so well that i can feel it from with in ....like i said earlier it almost feels like new collagen has formed in my skin...sound like a big claim to make...but i keep going back to these vitamins for a reason...this is more then my 3rd year of using these vitamins....i love them and for the price it makes me feel great.Beauty doesn't have to cost a fortune...i appreciate this company for making these great vitamins for less then half the cost of what others will charge for that don't even have the potent ingredients ,this multivitamin has!It has made my skin have that beautiful glow you get when pregnant or just getting out of a nice warm steamy bath.My hair is going like crazy,not kidding i think like 12 inches a year...no joke!My nails have grown thicker stronger like my hair and have a beautiful shine to them....they always look healthy.I love this and for the price i will keep using them as directed.They are easy to swallow and work quickly....i noticed a differnce in my skin immed.wanted to also say i used the expensive Dr.Andrew Lessman for years and i like these much better and ,these are more potent and cheaper in my opinion and this company is backed by science,i use all their supp.The price is so affordable and i do appreciate this company for making this vitamin available to us.Love how it has collagen and alpha lipoic acid in it too.Good beauty investment....starts within!
